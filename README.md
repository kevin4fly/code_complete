#Code_Complete

This repository is forked from [mbbill/code_complete](https://github.com/mbbill/code_complete)

I have changed something so that it is able to co-exist with YouCompleteMe and
Ultisnips plugins.

Removed all template related code from the original plugin due to we have
ultisnips plugin.

And now, we have `<tab>` to:

1. select what we want from the popup menu
2. trigger code snippets via Ultisnips
3. jump among Ultisnips' blocks
4. function parameters' completion
5. switch among function parameters
